# Measurements

The 'measurement' system is an attempt to encode any standard measurement
type, and it's underlying SI unit representation in a comprehensive, but
compact manner.

This system is a work in progress, and the values, names and groups will see
regular changes until an initial, versioned release of zscilib happens.
